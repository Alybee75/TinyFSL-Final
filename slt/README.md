# Sign Language Transformers (CVPR'20)

This repo contains the training and evaluation code for the paper [Sign Language Transformers: Sign Language Transformers: Joint End-to-end Sign Language Recognition and Translation](https://www.cihancamgoz.com/pub/camgoz2020cvpr.pdf). 

This code is based on [Joey NMT](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt) but modified to realize joint continuous sign language recognition and translation. For text-to-text translation experiments, you can use the original Joey NMT framework.
